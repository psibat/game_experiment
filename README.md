Stealth based game where you play a Scientist in an alternate |1950-60s timeline where certain protosciences are real. 

You play as Professor Philo Panopolis, worlds leading Hermetic Scientist, and ex-employee of Heiroglyph Science (HgS). After recently being fired by Missy Ozmand (Miss C.E.O - Miseo) for discovering that the secret to the companys most recent invention, the @Elixir of Life@ involves stealing the life force of test subjects.
Using the his most recent invention HANDs Hermetic.Articulated.Nifty.Devices (gloves that allow the break down and transmution of objects) Philo must sabotage his ex employer and hopefully save some prisoners along the way.
